### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL:(https://stefanswart.github.io/stats-preview-card-component-main/)

## My process

- First I did the html markup and then completed the css. I went back and forth between html and css as I figured things out.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to overlay color on to an image but i could not get the image to match the original. My color was very light and did not have much contrast.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I'm still working on a uDemy course (The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021 by Colt Steele). I also plan to do more frontend mentor challenges and using mdn to do research as I work.

### Useful resources

- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me reseach css properties and how to use them.
